Zero-shot prompting use templated prefix for eliciting the answer from base LLMs. Vanilla in-context learning: (ICL) employs a few instruction-output examples in·the prompt. Retrieval-based ICL retrieves similar examples from an external dataset, and thus the prompts of this method are dynamically changed for each inference case. Our URIAL uses static prompts like vanilla ICL does, but adds a systemi-level prompt and restyles the output parts of in-context examples.
