Wenchang Lei Philisense Changsha, Hunan, China leiwenchang@philisense.com LGM: Enhancing Large Language Models with Conceptual Meta-Relations and Iterative RetrievalFeng Sun Philisense Changsha, Hunan, China sunfeng@philisense.com Abstract Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet strug- gle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity by extracting meta-relations—inheritance, alias, and composition—from natural language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these meta-relations . Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm , these rela- tions and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM, improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines. 1With the rapid advancement of large language model (LLMs), they have demonstrated near-human semantic reasoning capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. Nevertheless, LLMs that rely solely on parameterized memory still exhibit significant limitations in handling factual knowledge, up-to-date information, and domain-specific expertise. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was proposed, which enhances reasoning by retrieving external knowledge sources or documents during inference, thereby improving the accuracy and interpretability of model outputs. Early RAG-based systems and products, such as Dify [ 1 ], Storm [ 2 ], and FastRAG [ 3 ], typically fragment knowledge into vectorized chunks stored in vector databases. At inference time, a query is vectorized, and the top-K most similar fragments are injected into the LLM for augmentation. While effective for single-hop queries, these approaches perform poorly on multi-hop reasoning tasks, such as those in HotpotQA [ 4 ] and Musique [ 5 ]. In such cases, the required knowledge spans multiple fragments, where later fragments depend on the interpretation of earlier ones.",

    "text": "2 Related Work Formally, we define expandable knowledge as: Our contributions can be summarized as follows:2.1 Knowledge Scope and Expandable Knowledge • We incorporate a reflection mechanism to validate extracted concept relations. Since the world’s knowledge is inherently graph-structured, graphs provide a natural representation for complex relationships. This observation connects RAG to the evolution of knowledge graphs [ 7 ] (KGs), which excel in semantic search, relation extraction, and reasoning. Recent work on Graph Language Model (GLM) [ 8 ] directly integrates KGs into LLMs for knowledge augmentation. However, KGs often rely on subject–predicate–object triples, which lose essential context, modifiers, and constraints when representing complex semantics. To alleviate this, methods such as Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG) [ 9 ] link KGs with raw textual sources, but their ontology-driven construction requires substantial manual effort by domain experts, limiting scalability. Consequently, more recent approaches, such as GraphRAG [ 10 ] and LightRAG [ 11 ], employ LLMs to extract concepts and relations directly from natural language for graph construction. Despite these advances, existing methods typically use concept-containing paragraphs as inputs to LLMs. Such paragraphs often include irrelevant information and overlook scattered but related statements, such as pronouns, abbreviations, or aliases. As the knowledge base grows and queries become more complex, the required retrieval scope expands beyond what the limited context window of LLMs can accommodate. Moreover, long-context inputs suffer from the “lost in the middle [12]” problem. Inspired by Daoist philosophy—“The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, and Three gives birth to all things”—we introduce the notion of meta-relations among concepts, namely inheritance, alias, and composition. For example, fruit is the parent class of apple and banana ; apple is composed of peel, flesh, and core; the properties of a parent concept are the intersection of its children, while the capabilities of a concept are the union of its components. Building on these insights, we propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) , which retrieves concept- level statements rather than raw contextual passages, thereby reducing noise. To ensure clarity and completeness of concept definitions, we extract meta-relations from natural language and introduce a reflection mechanism to validate their reliability.",

Furthermore, we design a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm to handle multi-hop reasoning while mitigating long-context limitations in LLMs. Experimental results on HotpotQA and Musique demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines. Knowledge can be broadly divided into learned knowledge and unlearned knowledge . Among the latter, some items can be expressed and understood through existing knowledge, forming the basis of human learning. Yet, human cognition is bounded; given a fixed reservoir of learned knowledge, the amount of knowledge that can be expanded is limited (see Figure 1). where K denotes the universe of knowledge, L the set of learned knowledge, U = K \\ L the unlearned knowledge, C the cognitive capacity representing finite cognitive resources, T C ( L ) the set of knowledge derivable from L under capacity C , and E C the portion of unlearned knowledge that can be expanded from L within C . In large language models, knowledge encoded in training data corresponds to L . Representing new concepts in terms of previously trained knowledge constitutes knowledge expansion . Because both context length and attention are finite, concept hierarchies cannot be expanded indefinitely, and RAG addresses this limitation. The effectiveness of RAG varies with the underlying model’s capacity even when the same knowledge base is used. Current approaches fall broadly into vector-database-based 2 • We introduce concepts as the minimal retrieval unit and expand their definitions through Daoist-inspired meta-relations. • We propose a concept retrieval algorithm that simultaneously addresses long-context chal- lenges and multi-hop reasoning.

Another branch retrieves the original sentences associated with triples, together with surrounding context, rather than injecting triples directly. GraphRAG [ 10 ], KAG [ 9 ], LightRAG [ 11 ], and HippoRAG [ 14 ] exemplify this line of research. GraphRAG leverages community detection and summarization to organize text hierarchically for injection. KAG associates triples extracted via OpenIE with an ontology and indexes their original context. LightRAG also employs an LLM to derive triples, while HippoRAG simulates human memory by storing triples in a graph, retrieving via filtering and PageRank before presenting the source text. Although this reduces information loss, it introduces noise that can hinder generation quality. Context : “Apples are a type of fruit. Fruits contain many vitamins. Apples are sweet...” 3 Systems such as Dify [ 1 ], Storm [ 2 ], and related frameworks partition documents into small fragments, encode them as vectors, and store them in a database. During inference, a query is vectorized and matched against the database, and the top- K fragments are injected into the language model. These methods are simple, flexible, and inexpensive, but they degrade in performance on multi-hop reasoning, long-context processing, and cross-document entity alignment. Knowledge-graph-based RAG treats concepts as nodes and relations between them as edges. Early pipelines built graphs using triple-extraction tools such as OpenIE [ 13 ], producing sub- ject–predicate–object triples while discarding modifiers and adjunct information. Because language models operate most effectively on natural language, feeding triples alone yields limited results, as shown in work on [8].Concept-based retrieval aims to minimize such noise by supplying only statements relevant to the target concepts. For example, while some systems apply lexical or sparse retrieval methods (e.g., BM25 [ 15 ]), concept references often involve pronouns, aliases, or hierarchical relations. Information may reside not in the sentence where a concept appears but in its parent or compositional elements. Consider: Information may reside not in the sentence where a concept appears but in its parent or compositional elements. Consider: Consider:",

    "text": "3.2 Learning 3.1 Workflow 3 Language Graph Model Query : “What are apples rich in?” Simply retrieving sentences mentioning apples does not resolve the query; leveraging the inheritance relation between apple and fruit is essential so that statements about the parent concept inform the answer. Motivated by these issues and drawing on Daoist philosophy, we propose the Language Graph Model , which represents and retrieves concepts via meta-relations—inheritance, alias, and composition—to support precise reasoning. The Language Graph is an attributed graph comprising two subgraphs: a Syntactic Relation Graph (SRG) and a Concept Relation Graph (CRG) . The SRG structure is shown in the left of Figure 2. the CRG illustrating meta-relations (inheritance, composition, alias) is shown in the right of Figure 2.Figure 2: The left of figure is structure of the syntactic relation graph (SRG) and the right is structure of the concept relation graph (CRG) The SRG stores grammatical dependencies between sentences. By linking chapter nodes, sentence nodes, and their membership relations, it forms a document tree that records original sentences and lemmatized versions for efficient retrieval. The CRG stores meta-relations among all concepts, whose ultimate ancestor is a root node, Thing . To avoid mismatches caused by morphological variants, each concept is extracted from the original sentence and lemmatized via Stanza [16]. The Language Graph Model operates in two phases: Learning and Concept Iterative Retrieval , as illustrated in Figure 3. During Learning phase, the source document is split into sections according to its table of contents. All sentences under each section are processed by Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and concept-relation extractors, and the results are stored in a Neo4j graph database. During Concept Iterative Retrieval phase, all noun lemmas from the query are first extracted. These are expanded in the CRG via inheritance, composition, and alias relations, then mapped back to their corresponding sentences in the SRG. Finally, the original sentences containing these concepts, together with the query, are fed into the Concept Iterative Retrieval algorithm. If no additional concepts are required, the answer is produced. Learning is the core of the Language Graph Model. It converts raw text into structured, retrievable knowledge stored as graphs. After learning, two graphs are created: the SRG for original sentence 4 It converts raw text into structured, retrievable knowledge stored as graphs.

[: apple]”These templates are embedded in the LLM’s prompts (see Appendix 6). Figure 3: Workflow of the Language Graph Model information and the CRG for conceptual expansion. The processing pipeline comprises five stages: (1) apply NLP preprocessing to raw sentences; (2) store the processed content in the SRG; (3) use an LLM to extract candidate concept relations; (4) apply a reflection step to verify those relations (optional); and (5) store the validated, lemmatized relations in the CRG. Stanza [ 16 ] is used for classical NLP tasks, including tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and coreference resolution. In the SRG, sentence dependencies are derived from dependency parses augmented with coreference information. Each sentence node has a sentence property storing the original sentence with pronouns replaced (suitable for LLM input) and a sentenceLemma property storing its lemmatized form for retrieval. For example:An LLM is employed to identify inheritance , composition , and alias relations from sentences. Example templates include:Extracted concept lemmas are matched to their original sentences in the SRG. Sentences explicitly expressing the candidate relation are removed, and the remaining evidence is sent to the LLM for reflection . The model outputs one of three states: valid , invalid , or unknown . Because knowledge is learned progressively, some relations cannot be fully judged given current information; such unknown cases are temporarily accepted, similar to human provisional reasoning, while invalid relations are discarded.

    "text": "Here: 3.3 Concept Iterative Retrieval3.3.1 Concept Expansion Ext c = S c ∪ [ p ∈ P ( c ) Using the DeepSeek v3-0324 [ 17 ] model, we tested inheritance, composition, and alias extraction, achieving 95 % accuracy. Reflection effectively filters erroneous relations from low-quality documents but may reduce completeness on high-quality texts; thus, reflection is optional in the model. Concept Iterative Retrieval builds on the SRG and CRG produced in the learning phase. It comprises three functions: Concept Expansion , Parallel Retrieval , and Merge Response . Concept Expansion redefines concepts based on Daoist-inspired meta-relations, improving understanding and answer accuracy. Parallel Retrieval allows the model to process concept sentences of arbitrary length, extract information relevant to the query. Then Merge Response tries to generate the final answer by merging the extracted information from the retrieved sentences. The algorithm proceeds as follows: (1) Apply Stanza to extract concepts from the input question. ( 2) Use the CRG to find all aliases, parents, children, and components of these concepts (concept expansion; see Eqs. 2–4). ( 3) Retrieve the corresponding original sentences from the SRG. ( 4) Split the retrieved sentences into chunks according to a predefined chunk size . ( 5) For each chunk, combine it with the query and feed it into the LLM to identify supporting sentences. ( 6) Aggregate the supporting sentences from all chunks. If the aggregated text still exceeds the chunk size, repeat the extraction–splitting process until the size constraint or the iteration limit is reached. ( 7) If the limit is reached, select the sentences most similar to the query using a ROUGE-based [ 18 ] similarity measure, keeping only a chunk-size subset. ( 8) Submit the final supporting sentences to the LLM for answering. If the answer remains incomplete and the iteration limit has not been hit, output the missing concepts and return to Step (2); otherwise, output the final answer.

It further incorporates the union of the attributes and abilities of its parent concepts, the intersection of the attributes shared by its children, the union of the abilities contributed by its components, and all of the foregoing aggregated over its aliases. We formalize the full representation of a concept c using set operations, where A c denotes its attributes, B c its abilities, Act c its actions, P ( c ) its parent concepts, C ( c ) its children, Comp( c ) its components, and Alias( c ) its aliases. We first define the basic representation of c as the union of its attributes, abilities, and actions: S c = A c ∪ B c ∪ Act c .

Configuration Recall F1 Recall = N − U We evaluate the proposed Language Graph Model (LGM) on subsets of HotpotQA [ 4 ] (328 items from hotpot_dev_distractor_v1 ) and Musique [ 5 ] (241 items from musique_ans_v1.0_dev ). Two base LLMs are used: DeepSeek v3-0324 [ 17 ] and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-AWQ [ 19 ]. Baseline RAG systems include GraphRAG [10], FastRAG [3], LightRAG [11], and Dify [1]. Instead of exact matching, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge protocol: the (question, standard answer, generated answer) triple is passed to a single judging model (DeepSeek v3-0324) to decide correctness. The corresponding prompt sees appendix 9. If the judged output is empty or explicitly signals insufficient evidence, the case is labeled Unsupported . This unified judge avoids bias from using different base generators. Because LGM does not depend on fixed top- K similarity retrieval, we make no assumption about how many supporting sentences reside in any intermediate segment. We report Recall asWe analyze the contribution of each component via ablation on HotpotQA (DeepSeek v3-0324). The maximum input size was reduced from 120,000 to 30,000 characters. Figure 5 shows that F1 varies only mildly (std 0.009) and Recall remains stable (std 0.0038).

DeepSeek v3-0324 was accessed via its official API with a 64K-token context window. Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-AWQ was deployed via vLLM on two RTX-3090 GPUs, with a 16K-token window. Accordingly, the maximum input size for DeepSeek was 64,000 characters, and for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-AWQ, 16,000 characters. Because the quality of inheritance, composition, and alias relations in these datasets is high, the reflection mechanism was disabled for all three public datasets. Due to context-length differences across models, the maximum token size for each baseline RAG was adjusted as needed; all other parameters used default values. All baselines were tested using their latest public versions at the time of experimentation. Notably, GraphRAG v1 produced better results than v2 on these multi-hop datasets and was therefore included in the comparisons.",

Our model consistently outperformed mainstream RAG methods on public datasets. Future work will extend the triggering conditions for reflection beyond the learning phase, enabling more adaptive verification of concept relations. We also plan to integrate the SRG with the CRG to reduce graph complexity. In addition, we aim to incorporate tree-of-thought reasoning to further enhance multi-hop question answering, and to introduce the notion of domains to narrow the scope of concept-descriptive sentences, thereby increasing their relevance to the input queries.10 [10] Haoyu Han, Yu Wang, Harry Shomer, Kai Guo, Jiayuan Ding, Yongjia Lei, Mahantesh Halappanavar, Ryan A.
